                <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b>
                    born on 25 December 1876 to 11 September 1948.He was a
                    barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
                    Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947 and then as Pakistan's
                    first governor-general until his death a year later in 1948.

                    Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London,
                    England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
                    national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the
                    Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his
                    political career, Jinnah advocated for Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
                    between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
                    Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point
                    constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.
                    In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
                    satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.

                    After joining the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah worked for the rights of Muslims in the
                    subcontinent to protect them from the threat of marginalisation in a Hindu-dominated state. In 1940,
                    the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution. During the Second World War, the
                    League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial
                    elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the
                    Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety
                    of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree
                    instead to the independence of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of
                    Pakistan.

                <h3>Biographies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jinnah was once praised as the “ambassador of Hindu–Muslim unity” for his role in the Lucknow
                        Pact of 1916, showing how his vision shifted from unity to partition later in life.</li>
                    <li>In 1925, he refused a British knighthood, saying “I prefer to be plain Mr. Jinnah,” which
                        reflected his pride in independence and integrity.</li>
                    <li>He actively supported workers’ rights, serving as President of the All India Postal Staff Union
                        in 1925 and helping pass the Trade Union Act of 1926 that gave unions legal protection.</li>
                    <li>Between 1930 and 1934, Jinnah lived in London practicing before the Privy Council; biographers
                        describe this as his “years of contemplation” before returning to lead the Muslim League.</li>
                    <li>Even while gravely ill after 1947, Jinnah personally supervised refugee camps, becoming the
                        unifying symbol of Pakistan in its earliest and most chaotic months.</li>
                </ul>
